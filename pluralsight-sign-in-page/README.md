# Description

This is a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> Sign In page clone. I have used <b>HTML5 tags</b>, <b>flexbox</b> for layout and have also included <b>media queries</b> for smaller screens size devices.
<br>
Have also used little bit of <b>JavaScript</b> for password visibility toggle when clicked on the eye button next to it.
